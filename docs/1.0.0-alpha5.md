# 1.0.0-alpha5 changes

## Breaking

 - Property names have been updated to be more consistent, discoverable and aligned with standard MAUI properties:
   - `ShowHandle` is now `HasHandle`
   - `Cancelable` is now `IsCancelable`
   - `IsModal` is now `HasBackdrop`

## Fixes:
 - Fixes an issue where re-showing a sheet without instanciating a new one caused a crash on Android

## New features

 - A new event `Showing` is now available right before the bottom sheet animates in
 - On Android and iOS, a `Controller` property is exposed on a `BottomSheet`, allowing access to `UIKit.UISheetPresentationController` on iOS and `Google.Android.Material.BottomSheet.BottomSheetBehavior` on Android.
